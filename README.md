# FEWD-challenge1
Front-End Web Development Bootcamp course - challenge1

##Description

This project was developed to provide us with an on-the-job ticket task, which challenges us to find the flaws in the code and work to improve it for a certain goal. The problem it was solving was to make it more accessible, improve the SEO and consolidate the CSS by following the scout rule.

Things I learnt:
- There are lots of little nuances and ways of working with VS code which I need to learn
- How fragile it all is and how one small error can turn your whole beautiful webpage into an ugly mess!!
- I need to learn how to comment better
- I understand the need for a second screen and why it is important to git commit often!!

## User Story
